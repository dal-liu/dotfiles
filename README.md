# dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles. You can use them if you'd like.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dal-liu/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
```

### Using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

To set up every config, run:

```bash
$ stow */
```

To set up a config for an individual program (e.g. nvim):

```bash
$ stow NAME_OF_DIRECTORY
```
